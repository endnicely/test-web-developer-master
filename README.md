Please markup the provided website PSD using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A layered Photoshop file has been provided. Please contact edrick@dzap.net if any instruction is unclear. Thank you!

**Rules and Requirements**
+ You may use any html/css/js library or framework, except in a few special cases which are detailed below. However keep in mind we are more interested in simplicity, and your command of the front-end development languages, than libraries and frameworks.
+ For the comments area, please accomplish the following.
    + Please use the data within the provided Javascript file to populate the comments area with this data according to the mockup. You may edit the data only to fix mistakes or malformations.
    + Please use any Javascript templating solution such as <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" title="Handlebars" target="_blank">Handlebars</a> to render each comment.
    + Please order the comments beginning with the most recent.
    + For tablet sizes only (768px to 1024px), please omit the comments section, and have each remaining sibling column span 50% of the parent container.
+ For the large image area, please build a simple fade-in, fade-out slideshow with Javascript. Please have it automatically rotate through the provided slideshow images. You may use a library such as jQuery. You may **not** use a prebuilt slideshow plugin like bxSlider, Cycle, or Slick.
+ Please use your judgement to make this page responsive. It doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy, just an appropriately styled mobile and desktop version. A single breakpoint will suffice. You may use a framework if you like, but extra consideration will be given if you can example your command of simple media queries. Bonus points for exampling a "mobile first" approach.
+ Please ensure the page is functional in IE9+. Pixel perfection is not required, but please ensure the page is functional.
